## reactProject
This is a project I am in the process of working on to learn some new technologies and eventually to show what i can do.
I am using MongoDB as my backend Database and creating the front end using react and redux. The outcome of this project is to create
a single page application that can be used to look up player information from the game 'League of Legends' and display, store and use it
in a clear and interesting way.
